  requestText: 'please take this question and convert it to an image prompt - the
    prompts should be constituted like this:

    

    art medium (oil painting,
    photograph, miniature sculpture, anime, etc), description of an object, a background
    environment, by an artist

    

    the artists you choose from should be
    more contemporary and lesser known

    

    here are some good examples separated
    by |

    

    a watercolor painting, of a steaming cup of coffee beside an
    open journal, in a sunlit breakfast nook, by Elisabeth Sonrel | an oil painting,
    of a group of friends laughing together around a campfire, in a forest clearing
    under the stars, by Sophie Gengembre Anderson | a pastel drawing, of a peaceful
    cat sleeping on a pile of books, in a cozy library corner, by Henriette Ronner-Knip
    | an acrylic painting, of a small, vibrant garden full of blooming flowers and
    buzzing bees, in a city backyard, by Jessie Arms Botke | a charcoal sketch, of
    an old, comfortable armchair with a soft blanket thrown over it, in a quiet,
    book-filled study, by Charles Sprague Pearce | a digital illustration, of a bright
    full moon illuminating a tranquil lake, with silhouettes of pine trees in the
    foreground, by Ivan Bilibin

    

    choose from a wide variety of different
    kinds of artists and styles and objects and environments, don''t be vague in
    your description, everything should be specific and related to objects and their
    descriptive attributes

    

    do not include any quotes or formatting or
    new lines, just a string of text

    

    Do not include any introductory
    text or explanation, just provide the response

    

    Consider the concept
    of a random seed - I want you to create this prompt using a seed of 1'
